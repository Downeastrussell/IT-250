# Azure Data Studio (ADS)

ADS is the client tool used to connect to the SQL Server Database Management System. It will allow you to connect to databases in SQL Server and execute queries to add, update, create, and delete data.

## Installation

If you haven't done so yet, read and follow the steps to [Download and install Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download?view=sql-server-2017) from the Microsoft documentation site.

## Connecting to SQL Server Master Database

Read and follow the steps in the [Azure Data Studio Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017), but instead of choosing **Authentication Type: SQL Login**, you will choose **Authentication Type: Windows Authentication**.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Since ADS is built on the same engine as Visual Studio Code, you will find that the UX of the tools are similar - including useful keyboard shortcuts. Read the chapter [Keyboard shortcuts in Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/keyboard-shortcuts?view=sql-server-2017) on the Microsoft docs site.

In the chapter they show you how to change the keyboard shortcut for running a query. We highly recommend that you map that shortcut to `alt+return`.
