# Inheritance and Interfaces for Students

## Class Inheritance

You use inheritance when you have 2+ types and **all of them** share a common set of properties and methods.

## Interfaces

You use interfaces when you have many types in your system and **some of them** share a common methods and behaviors, but the separate classes can't inherit from a common parent.



In this chapter, you are going to refactor the **`Student`** class into two separate classes.

* **`DayStudent`**
* **`EveningStudent`**
